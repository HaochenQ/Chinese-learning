# Chinese Learning site designed with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can go to the site from [here](https://alex-chinese-learning.netlify.app/).

## About the file

You can upload your word list or create a new list via the site. The format of the file is described on **About** page.

## Usage

Go through all words either by order or using shuffle mode. Shuffle mode is good for self-testing. The definition and pinyin are initially covered, you can reveal them by clicking the corresponding fields or pressing D (for definition), P (for pinyin).

You will also be able to download the list you created in /compose page to practice the next time.
